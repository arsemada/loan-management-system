# Loan Management System

Project Overview
The Loan Management System is a web application that facilitates the entire loan lifecycle. It allows customers to apply for loans and view their status, while administrators can review, approve, or reject applications and manage repayment schedules.

Core Features
User Roles: Separate functionalities for Customers and Loan Officers (Admins).

Secure Authentication: User registration and login with Spring Security and JWT.

Loan Application: Customers can submit new loan requests.

Admin Approval/Rejection: Admins can approve loans (triggering EMI calculation and repayment schedule generation) or reject them.

Repayment Tracking: Manages EMI calculations and tracks payment statuses for each installment.

Dashboards: Dedicated views for customers (their loans) and admins (all applications).
