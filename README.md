# Loan Management System

Project Overview

The Loan Management System is a web application designed to streamline and automate the entire loan lifecycle. It provides a comprehensive platform where customers can easily apply for loans and track the real-time status of their applications. Concurrently, it empowers administrators, such as loan officers, with robust tools to efficiently review, approve, or reject these applications, and to meticulously manage the associated repayment schedules. This system aims to enhance transparency, reduce manual processing, and improve overall operational efficiency in loan management.
